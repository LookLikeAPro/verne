# Motivation

Verne started as part of a Redux powered webapp that reduces code duplication when interfacing with REST API.

Over time, the project became more structured and configurable, and creating a library became a possiblity.

The existing options for automatic REST connections in javascript are very limited. The best option, ember-data feels too heavy and not flux-like. The existing redux api connectors are hard to use, not configurable, and do not support pagination.

Significant effort is put into extracting the rest connector from the project it is part of and making it work without Redux, and that is how the ambitious Verne came to be.
